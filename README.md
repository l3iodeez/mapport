# Mapport Demo

This is a demo version of an app I created. 
It is used to serve data regarding inspections of customer locations for asbestos containing materials. 

## Main View

This view provides the customer with a dashboard from which they can select any of the facilities to which they have access. In this demo there are two facilities listed. 

## Building view

One a building is selected a gallery containing the floorplans pertaining to that building is displayed. The room numbers on that floorplan are links to lists of the materials identified by the inspection in that particular space. 

## Reports View

This section is used to allow downloads finished reports compiled by the customer. Reports can be uploaded by admin users and are stored using AWS, but no reports have been included in the demo.
